    <h2>Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Prepare the Pizza Dough:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and active dry yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until
            the mixture becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>In a larger bowl, mix the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive
            oil.</li>
        <li>Mix the ingredients until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until
            it's smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise for about 1-2
            hours or until doubled in size.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Prepare the Pizza Sauce:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, dried basil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix
            well.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Assemble and Bake the Pizza:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to its highest temperature (usually around 475째F/245째C).</li>
        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer it to a pizza pan or
            baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Spread the prepared pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a border around the edges for the crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add your desired toppings: pepperoni, sliced bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, olives, or any other toppings
            you like.</li>
        <li>Slide the pizza into the preheated oven and bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and
            the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
        <li>Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil, if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Serve:</h3>
    <p>Slice and serve your homemade pizza while it's still warm. Enjoy!</p>
