    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <li>2-3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, bell peppers, corn, etc.), diced</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil (vegetable or canola oil)</li>
        <li>Chopped green onions for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you're using fresh rice, cook it and let it cool in advance. Day-old rice works best for fried rice.</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs in a bowl and set them aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare and dice the mixed vegetables and chop the onion, garlic, and green onions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cook the Eggs:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of cooking oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet. Let them sit for a few seconds and then scramble them gently with a
            spatula as they cook.</li>
        <li>Once the eggs are cooked, remove them from the skillet and set them aside.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stir-Fry Vegetables:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil if needed.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Saut√© until the onion becomes translucent.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Add Vegetables and Rice:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the diced mixed vegetables to the skillet. Stir-fry for a few minutes until they are tender but still
            slightly crispy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Add Rice and Eggs:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the cooked rice to the skillet. Break up any clumps using a spatula.</li>
        <li>Pour the soy sauce and sesame oil (if using) over the rice. Mix well to evenly distribute the sauces.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Incorporate Eggs:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gently fold in the scrambled eggs into the rice and vegetable mixture. This will help distribute the eggs
            throughout the dish.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Season and Garnish:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the fried rice with salt and pepper to taste. You can adjust the amount of soy sauce and salt based
            on your preference.</li>
        <li>Toss the ingredients together and let them cook for another couple of minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Serve:</h3>
    <p>Once the fried rice is heated through and well mixed, remove it from the heat.</p>
    <p>Garnish with chopped green onions for a fresh flavor.</p>

    <p>Enjoy your homemade egg fried rice as a delicious and satisfying meal! Feel free to customize it by adding other
        ingredients like cooked shrimp, chicken, or different vegetables based on your taste.</p>
